# Handy-Scripts
A collection of handy powershell scripts that I've come up with over the years

`/General`

`- /`[Hosts](./General/Hosts) a utility for managing the local hosts file from the command line

`- /`[Set-CustomAliases](./General/Set-CustomAliases) Sets command line aliases based on the contents of a CSV file

`- /`[Start-KeepAlive](./General/Start-KeepAlive) Periodically 'touches' the keyboard to prevent a screen-saver or sleep timer that sometimes interferes with large downloads

`/`[Developer](./Developer)

`- /Clean-VSBinaries.ps1` - Performs a deep-clean on a Visual Studio Solution and purges all unneeded binaries including the /obj/ folder

`- /Find-InCode.ps1` - Allows for a search within just code files, excluding binaries
