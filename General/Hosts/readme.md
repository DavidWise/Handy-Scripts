# Hosts

As a web developer, I'm constantly developing different websites on my local machine and sometimes they expect certain host names for certain functionality.  THis is most easily accomplished by adding entries to the local ```hosts``` file.  

While this is a rather trivial task, it takes a few minutes each time I need to go in there.  This script makes it much easier
